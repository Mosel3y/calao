The idea
--------

Calao has been forked from ScoreDate  
ScoreDate has been inspired by Jalmus (http://www.jalmus.net/) written by Richard Christophe.
A special credit goes to him, who had the idea of creating such a useful program.
Font

ScoreDate wouldn't look so cool without the MusiSync font, designed by Robert Allgeyer.
I contacted the author and had the permission to modify the font to include the alto clef.
Please note that the TTF included in ScoreDate is NOT the original MusiSync font.
I named it "MusiSyncForScoreDate".
The latest version of the original font is hosted by Luc Devroye site
Translations

Thanks to all the translators that worked on Jalmus, ScoreDate is now available in 14 languages
The latest translations, done for ScoreDate are:

    Hungarian: thanks to Balázs
    Russian: thanks to Andrey Niakhaichyk
    Spanish: thanks to Blanca and Juan
    Portuguese: thanks to Raquel
